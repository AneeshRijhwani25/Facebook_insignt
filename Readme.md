}
```

#### 2. List Pages
`GET /api/pages`

Lists all pages stored in the database with optional filters.

- `category`: Filter pages by category (e.g., `Business`).
- `page`: Pagination page number (default: 1).
- `limit`: Number of results per page (default: 10).

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "total": 10,
  "results": [
    {
      "username": "boat.lifestyle",
      "name": "Boat Lifestyle",
      "follower_count": 120000
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Get Recent Posts
`GET /api/posts/{username}`

Retrieves the 10 most recent posts of a Facebook page.

## Bonus Features üéâ

### Asynchronous Scraping
The scraper uses asynchronous programming to handle I/O-bound tasks like web scraping and database operations efficiently, reducing delays and enhancing performance.

### Media Storage
Profile pictures and post media are uploaded to AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for persistent storage. You can customize the storage logic by editing the file `app/utils.py` to integrate your preferred storage provider.

### Caching with Redis
Redis is used to cache API responses, reducing redundant database queries and improving overall response time.
